#+title: wonky

A very simple alternative to conky

* Rationale
Impatience with conky's inability to handle basic unicode or emoji characters.

Most of what I want displayed is already generated by external scripts (mostly bash) and I need a simple plaintext viewer embedded in my desktop that can be periodically updated.

* Alternatives
** ImageMagic
I have lived with alternative approaches, such as periodically generating a wallpaper with the text annotated via ImageMagick. However this seems a bit hacky and inefficient.
** Conky
The original and best. Despite my above complaint, Conky really is the Swiss Army Knife for this kind of thing

* First stab
This is my first stab at the problem. Comments and suggestions welcome.
